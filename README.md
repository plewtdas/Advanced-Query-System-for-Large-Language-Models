# Advanced Query System for Large Language Models

## Project Description

Successfully developed and implementated of a sophisticated query system designed to extract meaningful information from vast corpuses of textual data, leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. This project focused on fine-tuning algorithms and prompts to deliver precise responses from two distinct corpuses: "The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi" and selected writings of Maharishi Ramana.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Algorithm Development:** Engineered a robust search algorithm to identify and rank top-k paragraphs relevant to user queries within the constraints of LLMsâ€™ limited context window.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Implemented efficient preprocessing techniques to enhance search accuracy, including word frequency analysis and query word scoring based on their contextual importance.
- **Scoring Mechanism:** Devised a scoring system for paragraphs by calculating weighted sums of query word occurrences, ensuring the most pertinent information was prioritized.
- **LLM Integration:** Integrated the search algorithm with the ChatGPT model to fetch high-quality responses. Fine-tuned prompts to improve the relevance and accuracy of the answers.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimized the query handling to reduce runtime and improve response times, achieving high ranks in competitive evaluations.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Innovated prompt engineering strategies to enhance the quality of responses, ensuring that the LLM delivered precise and contextually rich answers.
- **Open Source Exploration:** Investigated alternative open-source LLMs to compare performance and cost-effectiveness, ensuring the solutions were adaptable and scalable.

## Technologies Used
